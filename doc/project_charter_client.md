# **Users:**
5BI Students

# **Stakeholders and Expectations:**

Team: Create a client to comunicate with server by a chatting's platform.

Professor De Carli: Have a Client that can speak with the other clients using a server.

# **Purpose (Problem or opportunity addressed by the project)**:
With this client it's possible to speak among different classmates's clients through another Server.

# **Goals and Objectives**:
Our expectations for the good job of this app is expected to:
- Provide a way to chat with classmates;

- Facilitate the use of the latter to the customer;

- Interface with the server to communicate with other clients

# **Schedule Information (Major milestones and deliverables)**:

29/10/2019 - Create the file system of the program and planned the job

29/10/2019 - Addition of the graphic part of the software

29/10/2019 - End the main part of the software

05/11/2019 - Testing

05/11/2019 - Fixing the problems and bugs issue during the test

05/11/2019 - End the software development

20/11/2019 - Begin the documentation

# **Financial Information (Cost estimate and budget information)**:
This work does not include cash costs, the only cost was the time spent on this project,  approximately 5 lessons to which we have 3 hours each for a total of 15 hours

# **Project Priorities and degrees of freedom:**
We have no major limitations except the delivery deadline. We had all the time available, both at school and at home, we decide how distribute our work.

# **Approach:**
Iterative and incremental is planned.  Feedback will be used from one iteration to the next.  The first iteration will focus on basic functionality of the app.  Subsequent iterations will build upon that and incorporate more features as time allows.

# **Constraints**:
Approval is required from UMKC to make this an official UMKC app.  Any UMKC symbols used in the app must adhere to guidelines the university provides.  Consent may be required from the One Card office to proceed with the proposed screen scrape of umkc.managemyid.com.  We are proceeding with the project while pursuing this consent with the understanding we may not get it.  If consent is denied, the team will create an unofficial RooBucks app.

# **Assumptions**:
UMKC terminals are available and function when we need them.  Remote MAC Lab will allow our programmers to work away from UMKC.  Interfacing the app with third-party website is feasible.

# **Success Criteria**:
The project will be considered a success if (1) the team delivers an operational prototype at the end of the semester with the features mentioned in the goal section above, and (2) 80% or more of the team members would be willing to work together on another software project in the future.

# **Scope**:
At the minimum, the software will (1) allow users to check their Roo Bucks balance, and (2) see a list of Roo Bucks locations.  Time permitting, the scope could be extended to include features available to Roo Bucks users online, including adding funds to their accounts and tracking recent purchases.

# **Risks and obstacles to success**:  
A risk the team faces is a lack of experience in developing mobile apps.  This lack of experience generates a lot of unknowns.  We have  only a best guess for the level of work required for the features we have committed to.  We do not yet have a clear picture of how the code will be implemented.
