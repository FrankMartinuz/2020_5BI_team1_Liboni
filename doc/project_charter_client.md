# **Stakeholders and Expectations:**

Team: Create a client to comunicate with server by a chatting's platform.

Professor De Carli: Have a Client that can speak with the other clients using a server.

# **Purpose (Problem or opportunity addressed by the project)**:
With this client it's possible to speak among different classmates's clients through another Server.

# **Goals and Objectives**:
Our expectations for the good job of this app is expected to:
* Provide a way to chat with classmates;

* Facilitate the use of the latter to the customer;

* Interface with the server to communicate with other clients.

# **Schedule Information (Major milestones and deliverables)**:

29/10/2019 - Create the file system of the program and planned the job

29/10/2019 - Addition of the graphic part of the software

29/10/2019 - End the main part of the software

05/11/2019 - Testing

05/11/2019 - Fixing the problems and bugs issue during the test

05/11/2019 - End the software development

20/11/2019 - Begin the documentation

# **Financial Information (Cost estimate and budget information)**:
This work does not include cash costs, the only cost was the time spent on this project,  approximately 5 lessons to which we have 3 hours each for a total of 15 hours.

# **Project Priorities and degrees of freedom:**
We have no major limitations except the delivery deadline. We had all the time available, both at school and at home, we decide how distribute our work.

# **Approach:**
We proceed step by step, we start with the communication between server and client, then we take care of the graphic part and finally we combine everything.

# **Constraints**:
The only constraint we have is the protocol given by the professor which had to be strictly followed.

# **Assumptions**:
Our software should be similar to a chatting application commonly used on all smartphones, only more primitive and very simple

# **Success Criteria**:
The project will be a success if work without bugs and problems with all the different server that our classmate have done and in all the situation that we expected.

# **Scope**:
The purpose of the client is to interface to communicate, through the servers, with other clients like a chatting system.

# **Risks and obstacles to success**:  
The main obstacles encountered were in the generalization of the code for greater compatibility with the servers.
