## 1. Introduction

The chat client is a software that allows you to connect to a server that are using the chat protocol made by prof. De Carli.  
This protocol allows you to chat with other client chat that are using the same protocol.  
This document will explain you how to setup your device to use this sofware.

## 2. Setup the client chat software

  1. Before begin using this software ou will need to install the last version of python, and you can download it from this [link](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
  2. After you have download it, you need to open and install it, by following the instructions in the installer file.
  3. Now you need to check the installation, and to do that, you can use this command: python --version.

## 3. Install client chat application

  1. Now you have all of what you need, and we can proceed in the installation.
  2. First of all you need to download the source file of the client software, from this [link](https://github.com/FrankMartinuz/2020_5BI_team1_Liboni/tree/master/bin/ClientChat/bin)
  3. Now put all of that file inside a folder and place it where you want to place the programm, but pay attention to not change to file ordere inside the folder.
  4. Open the Graphic_client.py with python and you have done the installation.

## 5. System Maintenance

  If you find some uncorrected bugs, you can also fix it without our authorizzation, because you have already the source file.
  The code is organizzed with the UTF-8 standard, so you can read it more easly.
  If you does not find that particular part of code that gave you an error, it's probably because the error is not inside the Graphic_client.py, but probaly inside the Client_TCP.py, that is the object of the client.
