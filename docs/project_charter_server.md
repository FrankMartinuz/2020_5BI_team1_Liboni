**Project Title:** Server Chat

**Start Date:** 22/10/2019

**End Date:** 12/11/2019

**Project Manager:** Andrea Liboni

**Project Sponsor:** ITI Marconi

**Customer:** Professor De Carli Lorenzo

**Users:** 5BI Students

**Stakeholders and Expectations:**

Team: Create a server for 'chatting' between the clients

Professor De Carli: Have a server that can manage all the clients request (based on his protocols)

**Purpose (Problem or opportunity addressed by the project)**:

With this server every group's member can chat with another classmate. The advantage of this system is that it's more secure because it's working only on the LAN

**Goals and Objectives**: The overall goal is to give students a method to chat with their classmate. The app is expected to:

- Provide a way to chat with class members.

- Give to client a server that can manage all request.

- guarantee to every client a reply in useful time.

**Financial Information (Cost estimate and budget information)**:

There are not production costs, in terms of money. We have only spend an a amount of 4 lesson at school.

3 (hours for lesson) * 4 (lessons) = 12 total hours

**Project Priorities and degrees of freedom**:

We have a deadlines, and in based on need we spend our time for not exceed it.
We have total freedom on this project, the only restriction is that we have to manage the data with a preset protocol.
During the creation our roles are changeable, and often we collaborate on the same thing.

**Approach**:

We approach the project step by step. Starting from the creation of a listening server.
Successively every packet-request available stand for one steps.
In the final test we create two example clients to test our application.

**Constraints**:

Follow rigorously the teacher protocol's for guarantee the right connect with the clients.
If we not pay attention to the protocol, our server will crash because it can't correctly comunicate with the clients.

**Assumptions**:

Our server can potentially always remain operative, and reply to all of the clients. These server will be available only on the school LAN.

**Success Criteria**: The project will be considered a success if (1) the team delivers an operational prototype at the end of the semester with the features mentioned in the goal section above, and (2) 80% or more of the team members would be willing to work together on another software project in the future.

**Scope**: At the minimum, the software will (1) allow users to check their Roo Bucks balance, and (2) see a list of Roo Bucks locations.  Time permitting, the scope could be extended to include features available to Roo Bucks users online, including adding funds to their accounts and tracking recent purchases.

**Risks and obstacles to success**:  A risk the team faces is a lack of experience in developing mobile apps.  This lack of experience generates a lot of unknowns.  We have  only a best guess for the level of work required for the features we have committed to.  We do not yet have a clear picture of how the code will be implemented.
