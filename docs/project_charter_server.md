## **Stakeholders and Expectations**

Team: Create a server for 'chatting' between the clients

Professor De Carli: Have a server that can manage all the clients request (based on his protocols)

## **Purpose (Problem or opportunity addressed by the project)**

With this server every group's member can chat with another classmate. The advantage of this system is that it's more secure because it's working only on the LAN

## **Goals and Objectives** The overall goal is to give students a method to chat with their classmate. The app is expected to:

- Provide a way to chat with class members.

- Give to client a server that can manage all request.

- guarantee to every client a reply in useful time.

## **Schedule Information (Major milestones and deliverables)**

05/11/2019 - Testing

05/11/2019 - Fixing the problems and bugs issue during the test

05/11/2019 - End the software development

20/11/2019 - Begin the documentation   

## **Financial Information (Cost estimate and budget information)**

There are not production costs, in terms of money. We have only spend an a amount of 4 lesson at school.

3 (hours for lesson) * 4 (lessons) = 12 total hours

## **Project Priorities and degrees of freedom**

We have a deadlines, and in based on need we spend our time for not exceed it.
We have total freedom on this project, the only restriction is that we have to manage the data with a preset protocol.
During the creation our roles are changeable, and often we collaborate on the same thing.

## **Approach**

We approach the project step by step. Starting from the creation of a listening server.
Successively every packet-request available stand for one steps.
In the final test we create two example clients to test our application.

## **Constraints**

Follow rigorously the teacher protocol's for guarantee the right connect with the clients.
If we not pay attention to the protocol, our server will crash because it can't correctly comunicate with the clients.

## **Assumptions**

Our server can potentially always remain operative, and reply to all of the clients. These server will be available only on the school LAN.

## **Success Criteria**

The project will be a success if work without bugs and problems with all the different client that our classmate have done and in all the situation that we expected.

## **Scope**

The scope of the server is allow a user with a client to chat with another user that can be using a different client, but with a common protocol.

## **Risks and obstacles to success**

The main obstacles that we have encounter has been keeping the code the most generic possible, in order to avoid problems connected to the compatibility of the server to other clients.
