# 1 Introduction

## 1.1 Overview

This document defines the requirements of the server and client that we develop in the laboratory. For this reason every section will be divded into two part, one for the client and one for the server.  
This document will be useful for the user and for the developer that will need to work on the code.

## 1.2 Objectives
### *Server*
* Develop a server able to make chat client.
* The server will work with different client, but using the same protocol.
* The server have some feature to help the final user in the use of the software.

### *Client*
* punto uno...
* punto due...

## 1.3 Scope

### *Server*
The scope of the server is make communicate an N number of clients between them, and offert at the users some function that can halp, like see the online users and write a brodcast message.


## 1.4 Definitions
definizioni di cose che possono non essere chiare nel documento

## 1.5 Document Conventions

GUI - is the acronym of Graphic User Interface  

## 1.6 Assumptions

### *Server*
It is assumed that the client and server are in the same local network, and the firewall is disabled or is integrated a rule that allow the flow of the packet.

# 2 General Design Constraints

## 2.1 Product Environment

### *Server*
The server's software will be put on a server machine, that have to be always active, to permit all the client to connect it and use his services.


## 2.2 User Characteristics

### *Server*
In the server there are no different user, there is only one basic level that allow you to chat with every client online.


## 2.3 Mandated Constraints

### *Server*
The only constraints that we encounter is the obbligation to use the protocol that the professor De Carli gave us, this to make all the communication protocol the same.

## 2.4 Potential System Evolution

### *Server*
At this moment the software of the server is done, but is very basic, so it can be updated in the following ways:
* Add more security control
* Product a log system to keep track of the userm movements.
* Encrypt the message sent in network.

# 3 Nonfunctional Requirements

There are no nonfunctional requirements at this time.

## 3.1 Operational Requirements

There are no operational requirements at this time.

## 3.2Performance Requirements

### *Server*
No requirements for speed have been set forth.  
Memory requirements will be set by the size of the .csv file, that contains all the username and password of the users, but is a simple text file, so it is not relevant.  

## 3.3Security Requirements

There are no security requirements at this time.

## 3.4Safety Requirements

There are no safety requirements at this time.

## 3.5Legal Requirements

There are no legal requirements at this time.

## 3.6 Documentation and Training

The PALPIT documentation will consist of two major portions â€“ one dealing with the administrator features, as well as one dealing with the youth features. Training will be provided to a select group of administrators on administrator _and_ youth features.

## 3.7 External Interface

### 3.7.1 User Interface

#### *Server*
The server have no a GUI, so the only thing you will se on the screen is which computer identify by the IP address is connect at the server.  

### 3.7.2 Software Interface

#### *Server*
See User Interface
