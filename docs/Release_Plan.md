## Size Estimates (LOC)

Each column specifies estimated and actual values at the beginning of that iteration. For example, at the beginning of iteration 2 you know the actual size of the code integrated during iteration 1 and based on your experience during iteration 1 you can update the estimated size values for the subsequent iterations.
